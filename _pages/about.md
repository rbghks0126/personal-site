Hello, I'm Gyu Hwan. I am a Master of Science (Mathematics & Statistics) student at the University of Melbourne. I am studying coursework subjects in mathematics, statistics, operations research and machine learning. I will also be completing an 18-month research project. My current interest is in developing methods to enhance interpretation of non-linear dimension reduction algorithms using Gaussian Processes or Variational Autoencoders.

My career interests are in the domains of data analytics, data science and machine learning. I hope to work in a field where I can apply my statistical knowledge of machine learning and data analysis to drive powerful and innovative solutions.

I hope to use this website as a medium to share some of my projects relating to statistics, machine learning, data science.
