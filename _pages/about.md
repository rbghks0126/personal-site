Hello, I'm Gyu Hwan. I am a Master of Science (Mathematics & Statistics) student at the University of Melbourne. I am studying coursework subjects in mathematics, statistics, operations research and machine learning. I will also be completing a 18-month research project.

I hope to use this website as a medium to share some of my personal projects relating to statistics, machine learning, data science and so on. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
