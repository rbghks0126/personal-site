Hello, I'm Gyu Hwan. I am a Master of Science (Mathematics & Statistics) student at the University of Melbourne. I am studying coursework subjects in mathematics, statistics, operations research and machine learning. I will also be completing a 18-month research project. My current research interests are in both classical statistical machine learning and modern machine learning such as deep learning. 

My career interests are in the data analytics, data science and machine learning domains. I hope to work in a field where I can apply my statistical knowledge of machine learning and data analysis to drive powerful and innovative solutions.

I hope to use this website as a medium to share some of my projects relating to statistics, machine learning, data science and so on.
