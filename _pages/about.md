Hello, I'm Gyu Hwan (this is my first name). I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of Melbourne. I am passionate in data science, in particular its applications in cryptocurrencies/financial markets.

I am also deeply interested in long-term investing. I hope to work in a field where I can apply my statistical knowledge of data science techniques in the domain of finance and investment.

I hope to use this website as a medium to share some of my projects relating to statistics, machine learning, data science.
